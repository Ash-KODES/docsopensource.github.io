## History & Milestones ‚è≤Ô∏è

OpenCart was originally developed in 1998 by Christopher G. Mann for Walnut Creek CDROM and later The FreeBSD Mall. The first public release was on May 11, 1999. Developed in Perl, the project saw little activity, and progress stalled in 2000, with Mann posting a message on April 11 stating "other commitments are keeping me from OpenCart development".

The domain expired in February 2005 before being revived by Daniel Kerr, a UK-based developer, who used it as the basis for his own e-commerce software, written in PHP. The first stable release was version 1.1.1, released onto Google Code on 10 February 2009.

In September 2014, Kerr claimed that OpenCart was the number one e-commerce software supplier in China, while in August 2015 it was recorded as responsible for 6.42% of the global e-commerce volumes recorded by builtwith.com, behind WooCommerce and Magento and ahead of OSCommerce, ZenCart and Shopify. In February 2017, he stated that OpenCart had about 317,000 live OpenCart sites, which was, according to Kerr, more than Shopify or Magento.

Version 2.0 of the software was released in October 2014, featuring an extensive update of the interface.

Version 2.2.0.0 of the software was released in March 2016, after months of testing from OpenCart users.
Version 3.0.3.7 of the software was released in Feb 2021, in collaboration with Webkul.
